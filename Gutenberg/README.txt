## Description

Gutenberg is an educational project that demonstrates the integration of vision systems with FANUC robots, enhanced by Karel programming. The project showcases how to overcome the limitations of the Karel language to achieve complex tasks.

In this project, the user inputs a text string, which is then processed by the robot. The robot uses vision systems to recognize letters on blocks and arranges these blocks to form the input text. This process mimics the printing technique, hence the name "Gutenberg."

The project highlights the capabilities of FANUC robots in handling text data, converting characters to uppercase, and mapping them to corresponding numerical values. It also emphasizes the use of vision systems to identify and manipulate physical objects based on user input.
