## Description

Gutenberg is an educational project that demonstrates the integration of vision systems with FANUC robots, enhanced by Karel programming. The project showcases how to overcome the limitations of the Karel language to achieve complex tasks.

In this project, the user inputs a text string, which is then processed by the robot. The robot uses vision systems to recognize letters on blocks and arranges these blocks to form the input text. This process mimics the printing technique, hence the name "Gutenberg."

The project highlights the capabilities of FANUC robots in handling text data, converting characters to uppercase, and mapping them to corresponding numerical values. It also emphasizes the use of vision systems to identify and manipulate physical objects based on user input.

## Features

- **Text Processing**:
    - **Karel Programming**: Demonstrates advanced data manipulation and processing within the constraints of the Karel language.
    - **Interactive Input**: Prompts the user to enter a text string (maximum 25 characters) for processing.
    - **Uppercase Conversion**: Converts user-input text to uppercase, overcoming the limitations of the Karel programming language.
    - **Character Mapping**: Maps each character to a corresponding numerical value for further processing.


- **Vision System Integration**:
    - **Letter Recognition**: Utilizes vision systems to recognize letters on physical blocks.
    - **Block Manipulation**: The robot identifies and manipulates blocks to arrange them according to the user-input text.
    - **Vision Programs**: Available in the provided compressed cell folder. These programs facilitate the recognition and manipulation of letter blocks.


- **Robotics Integration**:
    - **Main Program**: The main program was automatically generated by FANUC SimPro.
    - **Additional Programs**: Includes two additional programs, IO_RESET and AIR_CONTROL, which initiate the conversion of letters to digital outputs.

## License

This project is available under an open-source license. Everyone is free to use, modify, and develop it further.

To run this project, RoboGuide is required. The project was written using RoboGuide ver. 9 rev. ZH.

Warning: Always test the project virtually before uploading it to a robot. Do not run it immediately in automatic mode on a real robot. It is recommended to use T1 or T2 mode first.

I am open to collaboration and any suggestions for further development
