## Description

This project showcases the use of FANUC SCARA robots equipped with vision systems to automate the process of picking randomly falling parts from a grinder onto a rotating table. The robot utilizes a vision system to identify and pick parts from the rotating table and place them onto one of two stationary tables, each containing four trays. If all trays on one table are filled, the robot switches to filling the trays on the other table.

## Features

- **Text Processing**:
    - **Karel Programming**: Demonstrates advanced data manipulation and processing within the constraints of the Karel language.
    - **Interactive Input**: Prompts the user to enter a text string (maximum 25 characters) for processing.
    - **Uppercase Conversion**: Converts user-input text to uppercase, overcoming the limitations of the Karel programming language.
    - **Character Mapping**: Maps each character to a corresponding numerical value for further processing.


- **Vision System Integration**:
    - **Letter Recognition**: Utilizes vision systems to recognize letters on physical blocks.
    - **Block Manipulation**: The robot identifies and manipulates blocks to arrange them according to the user-input text.
    - **Vision Programs**: Available in the provided compressed cell folder. These programs facilitate the recognition and manipulation of letter blocks.


- **Robotics Integration**:
    - **Main Program**: The main program was automatically generated by FANUC SimPro.
    - **Additional Programs**: Includes two additional programs, IO_RESET and AIR_CONTROL, which initiate the conversion of letters to digital outputs.

## License

This project is available under an open-source license. Everyone is free to use, modify, and develop it further.

To run this project, RoboGuide is required. The project was written using RoboGuide ver. 9 rev. ZH.

Warning: Always test the project virtually before uploading it to a robot. Do not run it immediately in automatic mode on a real robot. It is recommended to use T1 or T2 mode first.

I am open to collaboration and any suggestions for further development
