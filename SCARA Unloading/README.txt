## Description

This project showcases the use of FANUC SCARA robots equipped with vision systems to automate the process of picking randomly falling parts from a grinder onto a rotating table. The robot utilizes a vision system to identify and pick parts from the rotating table and place them onto one of two stationary tables, each containing four trays. If all trays on one table are filled, the robot switches to filling the trays on the other table.
