## Description

Gutenberg is an educational project that demonstrates the integration of vision systems with FANUC robots, enhanced by Karel programming. The project showcases how to overcome the limitations of the Karel language to achieve complex tasks.

In this project, the user inputs a text string, which is then processed by the robot. The robot uses vision systems to recognize letters on blocks and arranges these blocks to form the input text. This process mimics the printing technique, hence the name "Gutenberg."

The project highlights the capabilities of FANUC robots in handling text data, converting characters to uppercase, and mapping them to corresponding numerical values. It also emphasizes the use of vision systems to identify and manipulate physical objects based on user input.

This project is available under an open-source license. Everyone is free to use, modify, and develop it further.

To run this project, RoboGuide is required. The project was written using RoboGuide ver. 9 rev. ZH.

Warning: Always test the project virtually before uploading it to a robot. Do not run it immediately in automatic mode on a real robot. It is recommended to use T1 or T2 mode first.

I am open to collaboration and any suggestions for further development
