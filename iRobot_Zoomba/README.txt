## License

This project is available under an open-source license. Everyone is free to use, modify, and develop it further.

To run this project, RoboGuide is required. The project was written using RoboGuide ver. 9 rev. ZH.

Warning: Always test the project virtually before uploading it to a robot. Do not run it immediately in automatic mode on a real robot. It is recommended to use T1 or T2 mode first.

I am open to collaboration and any suggestions for further development
