## Projects
1. **Gutenberg**      : An educational project showcasing the capabilities of vision systems on FANUC robots, enhanced by Karel programming.
2. **iRobot Zoomba**  : A hobby project inspired by cleaning robots, created to understand workspace mapping.
3. **SCARA unloading**: Demonstrates the integration of FANUC SCARA robots with vision systems for automated part handling
4. **Telemachus**     : Uses machine learning to predict positional errors in FANUC robots, combining FANUC technology with Python for data analysis and machine learning
5. **Panopticon 1.0** : A Python-based vision system for FANUC robots, enabling flexible 2D object recognition with a static camera by converting pixel data to robot coordinates

## Usage
To use these projects, download all files within the specific project folder and import them into the FANUC robot using the RoboGuide environment. Ensure to compile KAREL programs (.kl) to .pc files within RoboGuide. Always test the functionality in RoboGuide before deploying it to a real robot to ensure safety and prevent any potential damage. For projects include Python script, ensure you have Python installed, open the project in Visual Studio, install dependencies and run the scripts.

## Support
These projects are created for fun using RoboGuide and are available for anyone who wants to use them. If you have any questions or need help, feel free to contact me at s.podsiadlo91@gmail.com.
